##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

Well, I based most of mine off the the SMACSS reading that we accomplished this weekend. Also, it seems that some of it is more common sense and qwuite subjective.
I am sure that I moved things into one file that others will think should go into another file.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did change the hard coded images in the css so that they would show up on the page. However, hr-img.gif is missing and I did NOT use my SVG from the previous chocolate pizza, 
so that reports and error of 404.
